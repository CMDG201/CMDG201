Welcome to the **Computational Materials Designing Research Group (CMDG)**. We are a multidisciplinary computational research group in the Department of Chemistry at IIT Indore, dedicated to advancing science and technology across several cutting-edge fields. Our work spans across:

🔋 **Batteries**:
We are exploring the development of next-generation energy storage solutions, focusing on high-capacity, long-life, and sustainable battery technologies.

🧬**Sequencing**:
Our research in sequencing leverages computational chemistry, machine learning, and AI to advance DNA, RNA, and protein sequencing technologies. We are pioneering the integration of AI with quantum tunneling for carbohydrate sequencing.

🔍 **Sensing**:
We develop innovative sensing technologies for environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial applications. Our sensors are designed to be highly sensitive, selective, and capable of operating under extreme conditions.

🌡️ **Thermoelectric**:
We are investigating novel materials and device architectures to improve thermoelectric performance, with the aim of converting waste heat into usable energy more efficiently.

⚛️ **Catalysis**:
Our work in catalysis focuses on designing and synthesizing catalysts for sustainable chemical processes, including renewable energy conversion, environmental remediation, and fine chemical production.
